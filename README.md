# CompressionQualityAnalysis
Computes MSR and PSNR after compression of an image to check the compression quality.

# To compute
Replace orignal_image.png and compressed_image.png with your own image files.

# Use
PSNR values defines how well a compression algorithm functions, lower PSNR values (0-15db) measns that the quality of restored image is bad, higher PSNR values (approximately 30-40db) means the compression algorithm works well.
